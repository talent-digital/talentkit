# Deploy scripts

## Local Development

In order to run the script locally you need to set a few environment variables - ask someone in the team for the values. Additionally, you need to set SEASON_FILE_PATH to a path where a season.yaml is located.

### Commiting changes

Once you make changes run `npm run build` and commit changes to the `dist` folder.
